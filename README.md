# A simple Blockchain project

Created a Blockchain project which can do following tasks:
  - Intializing a blockchain
  - Adding the block to the chain
  - Iining a block
  - Checking for the valid chain
  - Getting the full chain
  
Libraries used:

  - Datetime: to get the timestamp when the block is created.
  - Hashlib: to hash the block.
  - Json: It's function is used to encode blocks before hashing them.
  - Pickle: for serializing and de-serializing to use the python object later.
  - Bz2: used for compression.
  - Flask, jsonify: Use to interact with the web application
